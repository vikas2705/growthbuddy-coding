# ToDo Application

We'll need to implement a TODO app with a simple UI using React.
The exercise is divided into two parts:

Part 1: We will focus on core functionalities, such as:

-   Display a list of To Do items
-   Add new To Do item
-   Remove existing To Do item

Part 2:

-   We will add a functionality to fetch information from an API. For the sake of simplicity,
    we will be using a simple API which returns a random fact about cats!
    https://catfact.ninja/
-   Along with adding a task we will have a button which will add a random cat fact to our
    list of To Do items

Please run npm install as node_modules is missing from this project
